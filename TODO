- building
	- at higher prestige, consider enabling auto-build, auto-rate+
	- add push next to build-pull. rather than pull all builds down to where the button was clicked
	  have it push all builds down from the clicked button (clicking push-part will save all bits)
	- add push for rate+, similar to above only it pushes rate+ builds up from button clicked

- figure out a prestige strategy 
    - each item represents a fraction of the total 'value'. prestige can be tied to this value.
	- when to enable prestige upgrade
	- each escalation increase build&rate increases by PRESTIGE_BASE^PRESTIGE_LEVEL (i.e. 2^0 then 2^1, then 2^2)
	- each escalation reduces the build/s division ( div by )

- reveal item rows in descending item # (i.e build table upside down)

- game play
	- add in a perpetual motion machine
	- introduce clusters (groups of n consecutive items). cluster value milestones can trigger events
	- use value to buy more clusters or individual items
	
	- detemine activation criteria for
		- build pull/push buttons
		- rate+ pull/push buttons
		- build 1/2, max buttons
		- rate+ 1/2, max buttons

- button to blow local(storage away hard reset)
