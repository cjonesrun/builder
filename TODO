- localstorage
	- versioning

- building
	- at higher prestige, consider enabling auto-build, auto-rate+
	- add push next to build-pull. rather than pull all builds down to where the button was clicked
	  have it push all builds down from the clicked button (clicking push-part will save all bits)
	- add push for rate+, similar to above only it pushes rate+ builds up from button clicked

- figure out a prestige strategy 
    - each item represents a fraction of the total 'value'. prestige can be tied to this value.
	- when to enable prestige upgrade
	- each escalation increase build&rate increases by pmm.base^pmm.current_level (i.e. 2^0 then 2^1, then 2^2)
	- each escalation reduces the build/s division ( div by )

- reveal item rows in descending item # (i.e build table upside down)

- game play
	- add in a perpetual motion machine (PMMs prestige)
		- no accrual for item #0, nor rate+ buttons
		- last item in cluster builds item #0
		- eg. 1st cluster: start with 5 items, once item #5 starts producing bits (item 0), perpetual motion PM can be "bought", reducing value to 0 (i.e. selling all items)
			  2nd cluster: has, say, 10 items. once item 10 starts producing bits (item 0), next PM level can be "bought". 
			  etc...
		- PMMs will speed things up a bit with level increase, the more you pay for a PMM (i'e the more you let the builder run in PMM mode), the more it will speed things up.
	
	- detemine activation criteria for
		- new items (make this interactive)
		- build pull/push buttons
		- rate+ pull/push buttons
		- build 1/2, max buttons
		- rate+ 1/2, max buttons

	- more sophisicated build rules (10xX builds 1xY, 7xZ and 4xW build 1xY, etc), tree rather than linked list

- responsive for mobile

- auto-clickers timer/intervals
	- upgradeable auto clickers on each build/rate+/push/pull button.
	- upgrading increases clicking rate, costs value.

- stats
	- time to get to item X
	- highest val, fatest build rate (beta), highest acceleration (gamma)
	- total spent
	- 

- look into javascript modules, O.o, polymer project
