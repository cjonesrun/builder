Engine:

- Rube Goldberg machines build items hierarchically based on manual input. However, if manual input stops, system will stall... until perpetual motion is attained.
- build items one at a time. 
- checking the 'build' checkbox will decay items into the next item (eg, bits into parts) using a halflife calculation. 
- higher item count has the benefit of longer halflife (slower decay) yeilding more items pruduced from decay

Perpetual Motion

- When a perpetual motion machine is built, lowest order items will be generated by the highest order items. Efficiency of the pmm will initially be very low and be upgradeable.
- Cost for upgrading a pmm's efficiency will increase exponentially.
- When a pmm's efficiency reaches 100%, engine escalation can be 'bought'

Escalation

- begin creating new/other pmms 
- assemble previously build pmms into new pmms

Sentience & Efficiency of PMMs

- Efficiency is the rate at which highest order items build lowest order.
- Sentience is the ability for a pmm to make increasing better decisions about how it will optimize itself

- Initially, eff and sen will be 0%.

- Cost for upgrading a pmm's efficiency will increase exponentially.
- Cost for upgrading a pmm's sentience will increase exponentially.
