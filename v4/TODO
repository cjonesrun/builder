initial:

c-values: c0=0.00, c1=5.00
c-rates: c0-rate=1.00, c1-rate=0.0

z-units: z0..zN

unit	build cost					produces		upgrade production	manual build multiplier
z0		1 z0 costs c0,c1			c1				costs z0			n/al
for i>0
zi 		1 zi costs c0, c1, zi-1		zi-1			costs zi 			costs zi+1

function for cost calc

i=0: 1xc0 and 10xc1
i>0: 1xc0 and f(i, c1) and g(zi-1)

2nd phase:

add 3 more production units
c2=0.0, c3=0.0, c4=0.0
c2-rate=0.0, c3-rate=0.0. c4-rate=0.0

y-units: y0..yM
x-units: x0..xM
w-units: w0..wM

unit	build cost					produces		upgrade production	manual build multiplier
y0		1 y0 costs c0,c2			c2				costs y0			n/a
x0		1 x0 costs c0,c3			c3				costs x0			n/a
w0		1 w0 costs c0,c4			c4				costs w0			n/a

for i>0
yi 		1 yi costs c0, c2, yi-1		yi-1			costs yi 			costs yi+1
xi 		1 xi costs c0, c3, xi-1		xi-1			costs xi 			costs xi+1
wi 		1 wi costs c0, c4, wi-1		wi-1			costs wi 			costs wi+1



Notes:
c0 is a time-based increment with a rate determined by total value (or "level"), c0-rate. this will be the game rate limiter. everything else will be 
z-units main role is to produce c1 at c1-rate
y,x,w units produce c2,c3,c4 respectively (at c2-rate, c3-rate, c4-rate)

c2,c3,c4 can be used to increase z-unit production via additional upgrades

additional upgrades
use c2,c3,c4 to buy c1
